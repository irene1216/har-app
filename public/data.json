    "question": "I am completely bald, should I buy HAR?",
    "answer": "Sorry, no. We do not recommend HAR to those who are completely bald. In addition, HAR may not work for people with advanced hair loss - Norwood scale 7 or Ludwig scale Advanced (basically very few hairs left on the scalp). If you are not sure where you fall on the scale, get a free sample and test it."

    "question": "Can others tell that I am using HAR?",
    "answer": "No. Your hair will look completely natural, undetectable, even from close up, outdoor and under bright light.\n HAR is not the typical hair loss products (paint-like or shoe polish-like) you see on the market that were invented in the 80s of last century. HAR is a new, breakthrough product that quickly became a staple among professionals in theatrical and movie industries.\n Professionals love HAR because it is HD-movie-camera-proof: high definition cinematic camera can capture the smallest pores and finest wrinkles on an actor/actress's face, however it cannot tell natural hair from hair enhanced with HAR, neither can human eyes."
